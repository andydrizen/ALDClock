## What is this?

An interactive clock component for use in iOS projects.

## How can I use it?

Add both `ALDClock.h` and `ALDClock.m` to your project, and then `#import "ALDClock.h"` into your own class. Create an instance of the clock by:

```
ALDClock *clock = [[ALDClock alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.bounds];
```

and add it to your view.
